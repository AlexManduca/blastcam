NAME
       solve-field - Main high-level command-line user interface.

SYNOPSIS
       solve-field [options] [image-file-1 image-file-2 ...]  [xyls-file-1 xyls-file-2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Main high-level command-line user interface for astrometry.net

       You can specify http:// or ftp:// URLs instead of filenames.  The "wget" or "curl" program will be used to retrieve the URL.

       The  astrometry  engine  will  take any image and return the astrometry world coordinate system (WCS), ie a standards-based description of the (usually nonlinear) transformation
       between image coordinates and sky coordinates with absolutely no “false positives” (but maybe some “no answers”). It will do its best, even  when  the  input  image  has  no  or
       totally incorrect meta data.
